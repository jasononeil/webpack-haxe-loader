This is the [Haxe](https://haxe.org) loader for Webpack.

If you're unsure why you should be using Webpack, read 
[an introduction to Webpack for Haxe developers](webpack-tips.md).

## Getting Started

### Examples

There is a small example Haxe+Webpack project presenting 
[vanilla DOM](https://github.com/elsassph/webpack-haxe-example) 
and [React](https://github.com/elsassph/webpack-haxe-example/tree/react) approaches.
These examples gives you a sample functional Webpack config, a couple of classes and leverage
Webpack features like:

- loading images, styles and configuration,
- code splitting,
- and hot-module replacement (with React).

### Installation

    yarn add --dev haxe-loader

or

    npm install --save-dev haxe-loader 

You will also need to install Haxe 3 if you don't have it already: https://haxe.org/download/

### Running

Use webpack like normal, including `webpack --watch` and `webpack-dev-server`.

### Compatibility

Haxe Loader is compatible with Webpack 3 (possibly 2) and Haxe 3.2.1 to 3.4.x.

If you notice a compatibility problem, please log an issue.

### Configuration

1. Create or update `webpack.config.js` like so:

```js
module.exports = {
  devtool: 'cheap-module-eval-source-map',
  entry: './app.hxml',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js'
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      // all files with hxml extension will be handled by `haxe-loader`
      {
        test: /\.hxml$/, 
        loader: 'haxe-loader',
        options: {
          debug: true
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

You'll note that the input is `./app.hxml`, not Haxe code files: this loader will 
run the Haxe compiler with the HXML parameters, and include the resulting JavaScript 
into the bundle. 

HXML files can be the bundle entry point, as in this example, or can be "required"
from JavaScript:

```js
// in `myscript.js`:
const haxeApp = require('./app.hxml');
// haxeApp holds the @:exposed classes/methods of your Haxe JS
```

2. Create an HXML file for your project

HXML files are a way to specify Haxe compiler arguments; for this loader, configure
the compiler as for any Haxe-JavaScript project, and add `-lib haxe-loader`:

```
-cp src
-main Main
-lib haxe-loader
-js index.js
```

Notes: 

- the name/path of the JS output doesn't matter, but it has to be present,
- you can NOT use `--next` to specify multiple builds in one HXML.


## Webpack require and code splitting

### Webpack require

To require 3rd party NPM modules, you can use `@:jsRequire` metadata or
[`js.Lib.require()`](http://api.haxe.org/js/Lib.html#require).

However, those requires are relative to you HXML file!
It also cannot be compiled on platforms other than JS.

For assets/styles, it is therefore recommended to instead call:

```haxe
Webpack.require('./MyFile.css');    // requires a CSS file in the same directory as the current ".hx" file
Webpack.require('../locales.json'); // requires a JSON file in the parent directory of the current ".hx" file
```

It is silently ignored on non-JS targets.
In future we may try to handle require statements for other targets.

### Code splitting (load on demand)

To leverage code splitting, you must use the `Webpack.load` asynchronous
require, and provide the Haxe module you want to load as a separate bundle:

```haxe
import com.MyComponent;
...
Webpack.load(MyComponent).then(function(_){
    var comp = new MyComponent();
});
```

Using this API, the Haxe compiler output will be processed and cut into separate files,
and Webpack will emit separate bundles with these files and their required dependencies.

Haxe Loader offers and advanced API to control Haxe code splitting. For further information see: 
https://github.com/elsassph/haxe-modular/blob/master/doc/advanced.md#controlled-bundling


## DevTools / source maps

If you want to be able to debug your original source then you can thanks to the magic 
of sourcemaps. There are 2 steps to getting this set up with haxe-loader and webpack.

First, for haxe-loader to produce sourcemaps, you have to do a debug Haxe build,
for that you need to set the `debug` flag in the loader options:

```js
{
  test: /\.hxml$/, 
  loader: 'haxe-loader',
  options: {
    debug: true
  }
}
```

Second, you need to set the devtool option in your `webpack.config.js` to support the 
type of sourcemaps you want. To make your choice have a read of the 
[devtool webpack docs](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/). 

You may be somewhat daunted by the choice available, so here are some example strategies 
for different environments:

- `devtool: 'cheap-module-eval-source-map'` - Best support for sourcemaps whilst debugging
- `devtool: 'source-map'` - Suitable for use in Production


## Loader options

The Haxe Loader supports a number of options:

- `debug`: Haxe debug compilation (emits sourcemaps), and is suitable for hot-module replacement
- `extra`: Additional Haxe compiler arguments, applied after the HXML file
- `delayForNonJsBuilds`: See [advanced usage tip with non-JS targets](webpack-tips.md)

Don't hesitate to create a pull request. Every contribution is appreciated.

If you encounter a bug, please open a Github issue. As webpack configuration can differ greatly between projects, it is helpful if you can reproduce the bug using our [example repository](https://github.com/elsassph/webpack-haxe-example) as a starting point.
